# EbnkRichElement

A [Zend Framework 2](http://framework.zend.com/manual/current/en/user-guide/overview.html) Module that provides additional rich form elements you can use inside ZF2 Forms and Fieldsets. This module does also extend ZF2's formelement view helper and enables you to add your custom renderers by configuration, so you can add new form elements from any of your modules.

Warning: Don't use this module for production yet, since it's in development stage. Feel free to try it out and contribute or give me some code reviews and improvement tipps.
